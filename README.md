# The MandelP5ot project

... a modest Zoom on the Mandelbrot Set with P5.js and the Webworker API

This project is a "proof of concept" for testing the Webworker API in the 
context of intensive computing.

For this exercise, nothing better than a zoom on the Mandelbrot set !

And I always wanted to create a Zoom on the Mandelbrot set in Javascript...
so the opportunity was too good, I could not miss it ;)

You can play with this project in live mode, on Codepen :
https://codepen.io/gregja/project/full/ALGpyv/

The zoom series is taken from the book of Robert Dony : 
"Graphisme dans le plan et dans l'espace avec Turbo Pascal" (ed. Masson 1991)
The Javascript algorithm is a free adaptation of the algorithm of the book. 

Be careful : there is a bug with the "save" button, it doesn't work on Firefox,
but it works fine on Chrome. I'll try to correct it quickly.

This project gives me the opportunity to pay a modest tribute to one of the 
most important mathematicians of the 20th century, M. Benoît Mandelbrot.
